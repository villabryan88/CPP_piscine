This is a two week intensive course on C++.  There are 9 daily assignments with two group projects called `rush`.  
It can serve as an introduction to Object Oriented Programming, but some prior experience is assumed a bit.

Please refer to the `daily_directions` for information on each exercise for each day or rush.
